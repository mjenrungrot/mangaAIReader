# Intelligent Manga Reader

This is my personal project that aims to make an intelligent manga reader. Some functionalities that I want to include are:

- Read manga without any advertisements by pulling images from manga provider sources.
- Practice language translation by providing raw version and translated version. 
- Colorize manga. 
- Analyze the scene.

I will develop this during my free time. Please feel free to request any features by posting in issues and feel free to let me know if you want to join the project. 
Here's the stack I will use in development.

- frontend: react
- backend: python==3.6, pytorch
